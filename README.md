# Automated Speech Recognition for Text Conversion ðŸ“œ

Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) for Text Conversion is a project designed to transcribe spoken language into written text automatically. This repository contains code, models, and documentation for building and deploying an ASR pipeline using modern deep learning techniques.

## Features

- **End-to-End Speech-to-Text Conversion**  
  Converts audio files (e.g., WAV, MP3) to accurate text transcripts.

- **Model Support**  
  Integrates with state-of-the-art ASR models (e.g., DeepSpeech, Wav2Vec2, or custom models).

- **Preprocessing Utilities**  
  Includes audio normalization, noise reduction, and feature extraction modules.

- **Evaluation Metrics**  
  Provides scripts to evaluate transcription accuracy (e.g., Word Error Rate).

- **Easy to Use**  
  Command-line tools and/or notebook demos for quick experimentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip
- (Optional) CUDA-enabled GPU for faster inference

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srivaishnavi242/Automated-Speech-Recognition-for-Text-Conversion.git
   cd Automated-Speech-Recognition-for-Text-Conversion
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

#### Transcribe an Audio File

```bash
python asr_transcribe.py --input path/to/audio.wav --output transcript.txt
```

#### Batch Transcription

```bash
python asr_batch.py --input_dir path/to/audio_folder --output_dir path/to/output_folder
```

#### Jupyter Notebook Demo

Open and run the provided Jupyter notebook (`demo.ipynb`) for an interactive demonstration.

### Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` or the appropriate configuration file to change model parameters, paths, or preprocessing options.
